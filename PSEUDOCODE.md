PseudoCode
__________

PeusoCode is basically a technique which allows us to represent algorithms in terms of a more natural language instead using an specific programming one, like python or c++.

That’s why we can say that PseudoCode is extremely similar to the English or any other language you like to talk into.

Since we already know the fact that all computers are dumb, but are really good to repeat things, we create this kind of convention to express our ideas neat and clearly. Doing so, we will be able to share our ideas and understand other people’s.

## Our Mantra
		divide and conquer

It’s pretty known that splitting a problem out into several smaller pieces would be better to solve the problem like a whole.
		“if you have to get clean you room, it’s better to start with your toys, AND THEN with your clothes, AND THEN with your shoes, AND THEN with books, AND SO ON.”
Always about a problem like little pieces, attack them one by one, and conquer it!

Said so, let’s say there are four basic structure which allow us represent the steps on a computer:

## IF

This is a decision structure: here we need to perform an action due to a condition:

		“If it’s raining, then I need to get my umbrella. If it doesn’t I need to get my hat”.

Let’s see how our convention is going to write down this kind of things.

	
		- IF
		|  get my umbrella
		|
		- ELSE
		|  get my hat
		|
		- ENDIF
